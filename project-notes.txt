pu@ finding a way to explicitly map the url parameters to the action parameters [figured it out. the routing engine is smart enought to map url parameters to the action parameters with the same name. Even if they are in a different order.]

There's going to have to be some js plumbing that handles the updates and conversation making between the server. e.g. pings that server looking for new chat messages/moves and then applies the moves and messages to the client's page.

SQL Snippits ===============================================

- Initial creation of DB
-----
CREATE DATABASE tictactoe;
-----

- Create application user
-----
CREATE USER 'tictactoe'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'tictactoe';
GRANT ALL ON tictactoe.* TO 'tictactoe'@'%';
CREATE USER 'tictactoe'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'tictactoe';
GRANT ALL ON tictactoe.* TO 'tictactoe'@'localhost';
-----

- Create table snippet
-----
    DB::statement("
      CREATE TABLE user(
        id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        created TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(), 
        updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() ON UPDATE NOW()
      )
    ;");

Match Business Logic =======================================

- User1 submits request for match with user2
- Request is persisted to DB 
- User2 will recieve request as a response to his running "search for requests" functionality
- User2 submits acceptance for request form user 1
- User2's acceptance is persisted to DB 
- Server set's up match and add's users to it


Before I can Say I'm Done ==================================
- Add favicon
- Forgot password/username?
- shoulc add match type field to db (qm vs selected)
- make sure user can not log in on 2 machines at same time


Immediate stuff to do ======================================
